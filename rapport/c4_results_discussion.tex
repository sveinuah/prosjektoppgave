\subsection{Discussion}
% This decision was made in order to separate the implementation into its own module, and thereby reducing the impact of changes to AirSim. As AirSim is still developed heavilly upon, it was seen as a way to reduce the amount trouble induced by changes to the core code of the plugin. This would also allow me to more often integrate the bug fixes and new implementations they made, without ruining my ownw work. The downside of this decision is that it removes possibility to use any features in Unreal Engine which is not implemented in the AirSim API.
