The presented work in this report is result of the 9th term project of the Master of Science program in the field of Cybernetics and Robotics, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU. The project counts as 15, out of the semester total of 30 credit points. This means that there is substantial amounts of work behind it.

I would like to thank my supervisors Edmund F. Brekke and Elias S. Bjørne for the guidance and support along the way. Especially Mr. Bjørne, who has set aside a significant amount of his time to help read through, discuss and steer this project report in the right direction.
